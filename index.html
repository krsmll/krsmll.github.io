<p>My name is Kristjan, Kris for short, and I'm a freshman in <a href ="https://www.ttu.ee/">TalTech</a>!
<br> <br>
I study IT Systems Development and I like it a lot so far. I've been interested in programming for quite a while now
but never did anything on my own apart from taking a few programming classes in the University of Tartu. I completely
forgot everything I've learnt from there so essentially I came here without any knowledge of programming. I think I'm
doing quite well so far. :).</p>

<center>Here's a table with names and matrix numbers:<br><br>
<table style="width: 25%">
    <tr>
        <th><h4>Uni-ID</h4></th>
        <th><h4>Matrix number</h4></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>krmill</td>
        <td>194080</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br>
Holds only one name and one matrix number because reasons.</center>
