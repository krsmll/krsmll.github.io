<h1>Hello world and welcome to krsmll's awesome and absolutely epic website! :)</h1>

<p>My name is Kristjan, Kris for short, and I'm a freshman in <a href ="https://www.ttu.ee/">TalTech</a>!
<br> <br>
I study IT Systems Development and I like it a lot so far. I've been interested in programming for quite a while now
but never did anything on my own apart from taking a few programming classes in the University of Tartu. I completely
forgot everything I've learnt from there so essentially I came here without any knowledge of programming. I think I'm
doing quite well so far. :) Also, this number has to be here: 194080.</p>
